Open in From_VAE_To_GAN.ipynb in jupyter environment

Since the article is writen in markdown, not LATEX, I will try to match the code to print it in pdf if I can (Too many papers to finish this two weeks)

The figs seem to fail to load if they are in other document dir, don't move them when load the From_VAE_To_GAN.ipynb

Experiment code in:

Copy of cvae.ipynb
Copy of dcgan.ipynb

I prefer running them in colab
